Dear Mr Aron and all

Please note that all necessary actions were done to create a working simulation , to access this file make sure you have WebGl enabled on your server (local host which is your computer) 
you can use npm install http-server to run this file or you can run it by clicking the http file 

Please note you may encounter CORS (Content Origin Restriction Policy ) which may make it difficult from accessing this simulation I suggest running this in a sandbox environment

Feedback is highly recommended as I am still a learner and would love to know how I can become better

I have some links  attached to help you if you experience issues running this simulation script.
