# Computer-Graphics-apllications
This repository serves as my platform where I include my graphics applications I designed using WebGl and Javascript,HTML and CSS and OpenGL with C++ 

The first project I have developed during a project I have done in my Computer Graphics module at university

I haved developed a simple solar system simulation in WebGL and Javascript ,this is my first Javascript and web project I have done as a beginner C++ developer
Hope you enjoy my project

Within the future I will be including OpenGL and c++ graphics applications please be patient for these
Thank you
